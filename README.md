#  Job-Shop Accounting System

This repository contains an **individual project** developed for **CS-4513: Database Management Systems** (Fall 2023) at the University of Oklahoma. The project models and manages operations of a **job-shop accounting system** including customer orders, job tracking, process management, and cost accounting.

---

##  Project Overview

The system simulates a manufacturing environment with components such as:

- Customers and orders
- Processes (fit, paint, cut)
- Jobs and their assignments
- Department and cost supervision
- Accounting records and transactions

Designed with scalability and normalization in mind, the system handles CRUD operations, cost analysis, and reporting.

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Database**: Azure SQL Database  
- **Backend**: Java (JDBC)  
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS (basic UI for interaction)  
- **Language**: SQL (DDL, DML, T-SQL)

---

##  Database Features

- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**  
- **Normalized Relational Schema**  
- **Table Creation Scripts** with Foreign Keys and Constraints  
- **Indexing Strategies** (heap, hash, index sequential)  
- **Azure SQL Storage Optimization**

---

##  SQL Functionalities

- Insert, update, delete, and complex select queries
- Aggregate queries for cost/labor computation
- Range and random access support
- Stored procedures and transaction simulations
- Error checking and validation (FK violations, data types, etc.)

---

##  Java Integration

- Java source code for executing SQL queries
- JDBC setup for connecting to Azure SQL
- Testing scripts for all queries
- Screenshot documentation of successful query execution

---

##  Web Interface

- Minimal HTML/CSS frontend
- Supports customer listing, insertion, filtering (by category)
- Import/export operations
- Exit interface and error testing
